The general objective of this paper is to analyse how the aerodynamics of a helicopter works.
Fistly, we are going to describe how a helicopter flies in a point of view more practical, with help of the "Basic helicopter aerodynamics" and "Aerodynamics of flight".
Secondly, we are going to talk about the physics and mathematics behind this motion withthe help of the book "Blade elements - 
momentum aerodyamics model of a helicopter rotor operating at low-Reynolds number in ground effect".
Finally, we will analyse at a professional level using the "NDARC which stands for NASA Design and Analysis of Rotorcraft".
These are reports completed by NASA in which they combine manuals and technical worksheets.

<pre>
The general pgysics behind the flight of helicopters is that they generate lift through rotating blades rather than planes that they generate lift with their forward momentum.
This takes into account aerodynamic characteristics sucha as, complex wake structures of variable induced velocities. The rotor generates lift and trust to cancel out the forces generated by the weight
and the drag; this way it can produce a directional movement.

This essay will analyse the principles a helicopter's aerodynamics, including the momentum, blade movement, the induced flow and the drag generated. All this information provided will be backed up and referenced
at the end.

      <h4>LIFT, THRUST AND THE MAIN ROTOR</h4>
      Lift and thrust are generated with the main rotor. The main rotor rotates the blades at high speed this way acting as wings but in a rotating motion. This movement can be separated into a vertical which 
      is the lift and a horizontal which is the thrust. The total blade area divided by the rotor disk is called solidity ratio, it helps to determine how capable the rotor is to produce thrust. When the rotor 
      disk is overloaded, it creates insufficient lift and can lead to an aerodynamic stall, especially in high density altitude and weight.

      <h4>MOMENTUM THEORY AND INDUCED VELOCITY</h4>
      Actuator-disk theory also known as momentum theory, is how the rotor is measured to produce thrust. When the helicopter is hovering, the induced velocity pushes the air downwards this way generating lift. 
      Basic helicopter aerodynamics show how the induced velocity changes throughout the flight, especially when it goes from hover to decent. When the helicopter descends the induced velocity increases meaning 
      that the vortex ring state has reached a maximum, where the rotor gets caught in a round shaped vortex making the momentum theory no longer functional. In higher descending rates, the flow reverses direction
      and enters a windmill-brake system, which changes the flow allowing the blades to rotate on their own.

      <h4>BLADE-ELEMENT THEORY AND AERODYNAMICS FORCES</h4>
      While the actuator-disk theory describes thrust in general, blade-element theory analyses each part of the blade separately, this way explaining lift and drag when they are affected by different forces such as 
      rotational velocity, inflow angle, blade pitch and airfoil properties. Blade-element theory affects profile drag, induced drag and the complex airflow that is generated by the wake. 

      <h4>INDUCED FLOW, TRANSVERSE FLOW AND TRANSLATIONAL EFFECT</h4>
      Induced flow is an effect that pushes the air downwards through the rotor disk, this way it can change the angle of attack of the blades. Meanwhile, increasing the induced velocity reduces the lift efficiency 
      and the angle of attack normally this occurs in a vertical descent of a hover. When a helicopter accelerates forward it causes the induced flow to decrease at the front of the rotor disk while it increases at 
      the rear; this way it produces a lift differential known as the “Transverse flow effect.” 

      <h4>FLAPPING DYNAMICS AND GYROSCOPIC PRESESSION</h4>
      The rotor blades change position up or down depending on the lift this way it is compensated during the forward flight. Due to the gyroscopic precession, the maximum flapping that the blades have is 90º after 
      the strongest aerodynamic force. This means that when you push the cyclic forward, the blade’s angle increases on one side and decreases on the other side, this way tilting the rotor disk forward.

      <h4>DRAG COMPONENTS AND POWER REQUIREMENTS</h4>
      The total drag is increased when the forward speed is at its maximum, then the power required is reduced by the aerodynamic efficiency and translational lift.

      <h4>GROUND EFFECT AND ROTOR INTERACTIONS</h4>
      The ground effect improves the rotor efficiency because it disrupts the downwash and limits the wake development. The blade-element-momentum method explains how induced velocity decreases close to the ground, this way reducing the power required and increasing thrust.

The helicopter aerodynamics is known by the complexity of the rotor to generate lift and thrust, as well induced airflow, blade dynamics and wake behaviour. The rotor acts like a disk pushing the air down and like a set 
of wings pushing the air upwards creating lift. The effects such as induced flow, vortex ring state or blade flapping show that a helicopter is changing things in their aerodynamics. The pilots and engineers need to 
understand how the rotor and wake should interact, this way they fly safely.
