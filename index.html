The general objective of this paper is to analyse how the aerodynamics of a helicopter works.
Fistly, we are going to describe how a helicopter flies in a point of view more practical, with help of the "Basic helicopter aerodynamics" and "Aerodynamics of flight".
Secondly, we are going to talk about the physics and mathematics behind this motion withthe help of the book "Blade elements - 
momentum aerodyamics model of a helicopter rotor operating at low-Reynolds number in ground effect".
Finally, we will analyse at a professional level using the "NDARC which stands for NASA Design and Analysis of Rotorcraft".
These are reports completed by NASA in which they combine manuals and technical worksheets.

The general pgysics behind the flight of helicopters is that they generate lift through rotating blades rather than planes that they generate lift with their forward momentum.
This takes into account aerodynamic characteristics sucha as, complex wake structures of variable induced velocities. The rotor generates lift and trust to cancel out the forces generated by the weight
and the drag; this way it can produce a directional movement.

This essay will analyse the principles a helicopter's aerodynamics, including the momentum, blade movement, the induced flow and the drag generated. All this information provided will be backed up and referenced
at the end.

LIFT, THRUST AND THE MAIN ROTOR

Lift and thrust are generated with the main rotor. The main rotor rotates the blades at high speed this way acting as wings but in a rotating motion. This movement can be separated into a vertical which 
 is the lift and a horizontal which is the thrust.
The total blade area divided by the rotor disk is called solidity ratio, it helps to determine how capable the rotor is to produce thrust. When the rotor disk is overloaded, it creates insufficient lift 
 and can lead to an aerodynamic stall, especially in high density altitude and weight.


MOMENTUM THEORY AND INDUCED VELOCITY

Actuator-disk theory also known as momentum theory, is how the rotor is measured to produce thrust. When the helicopter is hovering, the induced velocity pushes the air downwards this way generating lift. 
Basic helicopter aerodynamics show how the induced velocity changes throughout the flight, especially when it goes from hover to decent. When the helicopter descends the induced velocity increases meaning 
that the vortex ring state has reached a maximum, where the rotor gets caught in a round shaped vortex making the momentum theory no longer functional. In higher descending rates, the flow reverses direction
and enters a windmill-brake system, which changes the flow allowing the blades to rotate on their own.
Momentum theory of actuator-disk theory is used in forward flight by combining the forward velocity and the other velocity vectors. When the rotor is affected by an nonuniform inflow can affect the simple axial-
flow in the process of hovering.


BLADE-ELEMENT THEORY AND AERODYNAMICS FORCES

While the actuator-disk theory describes thrust in general, blade-element theory analyses each part of the blade separately, this way explaining lift and drag when they are affected by different forces such as 
 rotational velocity, inflow angle, blade pitch and airfoil properties. 
Blade-element theory affects profile drag, induced drag and the complex airflow that is generated by the wake. On the one hand, the profile drag is produced when there is friction between two blade sections, 
 on the other hand, induced drag is created result of the downward deflection of airflow, this is visible because vortices trailing’s are generated in the blade tips.
NASA´s rotorcraft aerodynamics reports explain that there are small trailing vortices that generate the rotor wake, these are strong tip vortices formed below the rotor while hovering. When they interact with 
 the blades, these create unsteady aerodynamic loads. These vortices can only be resolved through a free-wake computational methods.


INDUCED FLOW, TRANSVERSE FLOW AND TRANSLATIONAL EFFECT

Induced flow is an effect that pushes the air downwards through the rotor disk, this way it can change the angle of attack of the blades. Meanwhile, increasing the induced velocity reduces the lift efficiency 
 and the angle of attack normally this occurs in a vertical descent of a hover.
When a helicopter accelerates forward it causes the induced flow to decrease at the front of the rotor disk while it increases at the rear; this way it produces a lift differential known as the “Transverse flow effect.” 
 As well, the translational lift only happens when the helicopter enters clean and undisrupted air, improving the rotor’s efficiency.

FLAPPING DYNAMICS AND GYROSCOPIC PRESESSION

The rotor blades change position up or down depending on the lift this way it is compensated during the forward flight. Due to the gyroscopic precession, the maximum flapping that the blades have is 90º after 
 the strongest aerodynamic force. This means that when you push the cyclic forward, the blade’s angle increases on one side and decreases on the other side, this way tilting the rotor disk forward.
NASA highlights that the wake modelling and free-wake geometry are a key part in predicting the flapping behaviour, especially in lateral flapping, which depends heavily on the asymmetric inflow and the blade-vortex 
   interactions.
